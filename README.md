In this article, we’ll teach you making a handmade ultrasonic sensor circuit. It is a very useful and interesting project circuit. 

The sensor circuit can trace any kind of movement in front of this and at the same the buzzer can make sound to alert you. 

The sound will be louder, when the subject become closer to the sensor circuit.

The best facility of this circuit is that, this circuit can be operated using only DC 3.7 volt. That means, this will safe electric energy. 


For making this useful project circuit, we might need some simple electronics component. You also can order assembled PCBs form JLCPCB. JLCPCB have its parts library.

All Component list have to been given below – 

Component List – 

•	Timer IC – NE 555
•	Resistor – 1 KΩ
•	Capacitor - 10µf/ 50v
•	Capacitor - 100µf/ 25v
•	Potentiometer - 20 KΩ
•	Power Source - 3.7v
•	Ultrasonic Sensor Circuit


Timer IC (NE-555) Pin Out - 

NE555 timer IC is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer, delay, pulse generation and oscillator applications. Derivatives provide two or four timing circuits in one package. 

There are totally 8 legs of a timer IC. 

As well as the 555 timer, there is also available the NE556 timer oscillator.

The internal block diagram and schematic of the 555 timer are highlighted with the same color across all three drawings to clarify, how the chip is implemented.

Its 8 legs Pin Out can be seen above.

1.	GND - The ground pin connects the 555 timer to the negative (0v) supply rail.

2.	TRIG - The negative input to comparator No 1. A negative pulse on this pin “sets” the internal Flip-flop when the voltage drops below 1/3Vcc causing the output to switch from a “LOW” to a “HIGH” state.


3.	OUT - The output pin can drive any TTL circuit and is capable of sourcing or sinking up to 200mA of current at an output voltage equal to approximately Vcc – 1.5V so small speakers, LEDs or motors can be connected directly to the output.


4.	RESET - This pin is used to “reset” the internal Flip-flop controlling the state of the output, pin 3. This is an active-low input and is generally connected to a logic “1” level when not used to prevent any unwanted resetting of the output.


5.	CONT - This pin controls the timing of the 555 by overriding the 2/3Vcc level of the voltage divider network. By applying a voltage to this pin the width of the output signal can be varied independently of the RC timing network. When not used it is connected to ground via a 10nF capacitor to eliminate any noise.


6.	THRES - The positive input to comparator No 2. This pin is used to reset the Flip-flop when the voltage applied to it exceeds 2/3Vcc causing the output to switch from “HIGH” to “LOW” state. This pin connects directly to the RC timing circuit.


7. DISCH - The discharge pin is connected directly to the Collector of an internal NPN transistor which is used to “discharge” the timing capacitor to ground when the output at pin 3 switches “LOW”.

8. VCC - This is the power supply pin and for general purpose TTL 555 timers is between 4.5V and 15V.

Feature - 

•	Supply voltage: 5V (DC).
•	Supply current: 15mA.
•	Modulation frequency: 40Hz.
•	Output: 0 – 5V (Output high when obstacle detected in range).
•	Beam Angle: Max 15 degrees.
•	Distance: 2cm – 400cm.
•	Accuracy: 0.3cm.
•	Communication: Positive TTL pulse.


Circuit Connection – Step 1

To make this circuit, we need to follow a normal method of this time IC. 1st we need to connect 2 and 6 no leg of timer IC-NE555. Then we connect 4 and 8 no leg of NE-555 timer IC.

It is a common connection for NE555 IC circuit. 

Then we connect 10µf/50v capacitor negative leg with 1no leg of timer IC and connect it’s positive leg with 4no leg of timer IC.


Circuit Connection – Step 2

Now we connect 100µf/25v capacitor positive leg with buzzer positive leg and connect capacitor negative leg with buzzer negative leg.

This is a parallel connection between capacitor and buzzer. Then we connect capacitor positive leg with 4no leg of timer IC.

It is the time to connect 1 kΩ resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with 6 and 7 no leg of timer IC


Circuit Connection – Step 3

This time we need to connect Potentiometer with the circuit. We connect potentiometer Vcc leg with 8no leg of timer IC. And then connect timer IC 7no leg with GND and Output leg. 

Now we connect power source with the circuit. We are using DC 3.7v battery with the circuit. Connect battery positive cable with 8no leg of timer IC and connect battery negative cable with 1no leg of timer IC.


Circuit Connection – Step 4

This is the final step of this ultrasonic circuit. Now we just need to connect sensor with the circuit. 

Follow the steps below -

•	Vcc leg with 4no leg of timer IC
•	Trig leg with 3no leg of timer IC
•	Echo leg with buzzer negative leg
•	Gnd leg with 1no leg of timer IC
